This module generates image quality benchmarks for a emission tomography
simulation with optional Poisson noise using TomoPy.

You can run the benchmark using the provided run-benchmarking.sh. The benchmarks
are divded into three main scripts. project.py which will generate the simulated
data. reconstruct.py which will use one dataset to do reconstruction for all
of the TomoPy reconstruction algorithms and rate the results using MS-SSIM.
summarize.py which will collect the image quality data into a JSON formatted
text file and pull in data from the TiMemory benchmarks if they are in the
same folders.

The default settings (running without options) should run a series of benchmark
tests as follows:

* Use phantom "peppers"
* Use phantom 32 x 2048 x 2048 pixels where each slice is an independent noisy trial
* Reconstruct with all the algorithms including the various filters for gridrec and fbp
* Use 16 cores (it's a quality benchmark, so we can use many cores and it doesn't matter)
* Report quality measures every 5 iterations for up to 300 iterations (terminating
early if the image quality does not improve by 0.01 MS-SSIM at each iteration)
* Generate a JSON summary of the quality measures as a function of iterations (or
time if TiMemory data is available).
* Generate a SVG line plot of the MS-SSIM quality versus time or iterations
